Convolutional Similarity Network Fusion on Multiplex
Multiplex graphs denote a collection of graphs that share the same set of nodes but possess different sets of edges, depending on the data source. As data availability grows, utilizing data with diverse source information, such as multiplex graphs, becomes increasingly important. In particular, if each graph that makes up multiplex graphs has complementary information, it can contribute to better performance of machine learning models. Despite this advantage of complementary information, recent research on graph-based deep learning models has mainly focused on dealing with single graph rather than multiplex graphs. Therefore, we propose deep learning framework specialized for multiplex graphs using the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) algorithm, which is one of the integration methods for structured data. In our proposed method, SNF is extended to the problem of multiplex graphs by exploiting the embedding process with graph convolution. As a results of experiments on toy and real-world datasets, the proposed method showed significantly better performance than comparison methods, and especially maintained high performance even in situations where there is little labeled data.
